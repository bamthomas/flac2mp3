# Description
This is 1 utility scripts (in `src/main`) for transcoding flac files into mp3 files keeping covers, tags, and directory structure. It is multithreaded and creates as much thread as the number of cores on the host.

The flac tags will be added to the mp3 files ut8 encoded, and if a cover.jpg file is found in the flac files directory it will be added to the mp3.

The mp3 generated will be itunes compliant (accents, covers) and encoded with lame command : 
`lame --silent -V2 --vbr-new -q0 --lowpass 19.7 --resample 44100`

# Why another flac2mp3 command ?
Because I didn't find one that included the cover and that did not break my accents on itunes. Cf http://www.barreverte.fr/ou-sont-mes-accents-dans-itunes (sorry, in french).
Second because I wanted it to be robust (for example with comments on multiple lines, shell caracters in tags like `!*$`) and unit tested.

# Compatibility and dependencies
It has been tested with linux (with python version >= 2.6.2), MacOS (>= Snow Leopard), Windows Vista (with python version >= 2.6.2).

Depends on `lame` (>=3.99 if you want your accents) and `flac` for the runtime.

Depends on `eyeD3` for unit testing and developing.

## Lame

Is a well known tool for encoding mp3 files. You can dowload and compile the code from the lame site : http://lame.sourceforge.net/

Binaries bundles can be found for mac and windows : http://rarewares.org/mp3-lame-bundle.php

## Flac

Is a free and open lossless audio codec. There are links to dowload pages in the official site : http://flac.sourceforge.net/download.html

# Usage
`flac2mp3 [origin directories] mp3/repository/destination`

- If one argument is given it is the destination : it will transcode flac files found under the current directory and put mp3 files in the destination directory with the same directory structure.
- If more than one argument is given, it will transcode flac files from the given directories to the destination.


for example, if you have :

    /path/to/flac/artist1/album1/song1.flac
                 |              |song2.flac
                 |              |song3.flac
                 |              |cover.jpg
                 |
                 /artist2/album1/song1.flac
                                |song2.flac
                                |cover.jpg


1) if you do in flac directory :
$ `flac2mp3.py ../mp3`

you'll have : 

    /path/to/flac/artist1/album1/song1.flac
            |    |              |song2.flac
            |    |              |song3.flac
            |    |              |cover.jpg
            |    |
            |    /artist2/album1/song1.flac
            |                   |song2.flac
            |                   |cover.jpg
            |
            /mp3/artist1/album1/song1.mp3
                |              |song2.mp3
                |              |song3.mp3
                |
                /artist2/album1/song1.mp3
                               |song2.mp3

2) if you do in flac directory : 
$ `flac2mp3.py artist2 ../mp3`

you'll have :

    /path/to/flac/artist1/album1/song1.flac
            |    |              |song2.flac
            |    |              |song3.flac
            |    |
            |    /artist2/album1/song1.flac
            |                   |song2.flac
            |
            /mp3/artist2/album1/song1.mp3
                               |song2.mp3

This is a work in progress.

# Development
To develop and test, use your favorite IDE (mine is pycharm).

With bash to run the test you can do :
`$ PYTHONPATH=src/main/:src/test/ python -m unittest flac2mp3_test flac2mp3_acceptance_test`

# Known issues

* weird errors when deleting temp cover images embedded in flac files on windows : "WindowsError: [Error 32] The process cannot access the file because it is being used by another process". But the transcoding is ok anyway.
* the skip file function is not working after windows encoding stuffs
